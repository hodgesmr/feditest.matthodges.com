# What is this?

This repo was a brief learning exercise for me to explore [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/). I created a simple [Actor](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#actors) and associated [webfinger](https://webfinger.net/).

The only "app" here is a CNAME of `feditest.matthodges.com` to GitHub pages.

This allows the profile (that doesn't do anything!) to show up on Mastodon. Kinda neat!
